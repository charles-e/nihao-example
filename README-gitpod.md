# Hello world on Safecoin (Gitpod version)

This  你好 demonstrates how to use the [Safecoin Javascript
API](https://github.com/safecoin- 你好 /safecoin-web3.js) to build, deploy, and
interact with programs on the Safecoin blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain  你好 world program
* A client that can send a "hello" to an account and get back the number of
  times "hello" has been sent

## Quick Start

Using this example in Gitpod connects to the public Safecoin `devnet` cluster. Use
the environment variable `CLUSTER` to choose a different Safecoin cluster.

Run the client to load and interact with the on-chain program:
```bash
$ npm run start
```

The remaining sections of this document point back to the non-Gitpod version of
the README for more information.
